            <title>Theos anthrōpophoros. Or, God incarnate. Shewing, that Jesus Christ is the onely, and the most high God· In four books. Wherein also are contained a few animadversions upon a late namelesse and blasphemous commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrewes, published under the capital letters, G.M. anno Dom. 1647. In these four books the great mystery of man's redemption and salvation, and the wayes and means thereof used by God are evidently held out to the capacity of humane reason, even ordinary understandings. The sin against the Holy Ghost is plainly described; with the cases and reasons of the unpardonablenesse, or pardonablenesse thereof. Anabaptisme, is by Scripture, and the judgment of the fathers shewed to be an heinous sin, and exceedingly injurious to the Passion, and blood of Christ. / By Edm.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ABout four years ſithence (Chriſtian Reader) there was brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me a Comment or Expoſition on the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> written by a Nameleſſe and unknown Author, to the end that having peruſed and allowed it, it might be Printed and publiſhed the which I alſo undertook: and finding (as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> then conceived) that for the moſt part it was Learned and Judicious, plain and profitable, I did ſo paſſe it with my Approbation; Yet there were divers paſſages againſt which I took, as I thought, juſt exceptions, as diſagreeing with the Scriptures, and the received Doctrine of Our and all other Reformed Churches, which I would not let paſſe, before by my Letters I had acquainted the Author with them, that I might receive ſatisfaction in thoſe things which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, from whom I received a ſober &amp; modeſt Anſwer, wherein he did not at all maintain thoſe errors, but left me to my liberty to expunge what I miſliked; the which I alſo accordingly did as I thought fit. But the Work being long, and my time but ſhort, divers other faults and errours eſcaped unobſerved by me, they being comprized in few words, and ſhort paſſages, and ſo the more eaſily paſſed over without my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The which Errors I the rather fell into, becauſe the Author was wholly unknown unto me, who am naturally of this diſpoſition, that I neither am, nor deſire to be more ſcrupulous and curious in obſerving other mens errors and faults then I have evidence of truth for it; whereas otherwiſe if knowing the Perſons with whom I have to deal, to be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terod and Erronious in their Doctrine, I ſhould be more wary and obſerve their words and works with a more vigilant eye: All which I ſpeak not wholly to clear my ſelf from all blame, (for I ingeniouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my inadvertency and want of due and ſerious conſideration in ſo weighty a matter) and therefore being convinced of my errour by divers Letters from men of great Eminency, both in reſpect of Place, Learning and Piety, and by mine own more ſerious obſervation, but eſpecially by the Labours of this Learned Author, chiefly intended to lay open and confute theſe dangerous Errors and Hereſies; I could do no leſſe (and indeed in reſpect of my old age and infirmities accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it I could not do much more) then revoke my Approbation of that (otherwiſe) Learned Commentary, ſo far as it maintaineth theſe perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Wherefore, ſetting before me the honour of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the ſervice which I owe to the Church, and to my Countrey, and alſo the care which a Father ought to have of the ſoules of his Children; I have endeavoured both to detect the blaſphemies of this <hi>Commentary;</hi> and alſo to ſet down (with all ſuch poſſible plainneſſe as ſo weighty a cauſe would admit), the evidences of our moſt neceſſary and precious Chriſtian faith in the Eternal Son of God; both by ſhewing his Divine nature, and glorious Godhead, who is our <hi>True, Onely, Supream, and Eternal Jehova,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of this our God, by aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming an humane body and ſoul, and thereby the ineſtimable benefits which our Redeemer, and Saviour hath acquired for us. <hi>Firſt,</hi> in exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſervants from eternal death by his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience <hi>Paſſive,</hi> in ſuffering death in our ſtead; and, <hi>Secondly,</hi> by meriting eternal life for us by his Obedience <hi>Active,</hi> in performing the whole Law of God as a <hi>Surety,</hi> and <hi>Undertaker</hi> for us.</p>
            <p>Theſe things have I endeavoured to ſet forth, not onely by the ſacred evidences of the holy Scriptures, and by the conſtant doctrine of the Church-Catholick in ſeveral ages thereof; but
<pb facs="tcp:115436:4"/>
alſo by humane illuſtrations, and the probable correſpondence of our Chriſtian faith, with right reaſon; Which thing hath been formerly much wiſhed, and thereupon laudably begun in ſome of the high myſteries of our Religion long ago by a Writer of good antiquity, to ſupply the defect thereof in the elder Writers; whereof he ſaith, <note n="f" place="margin">Rich. de St. Vict. de Trin. l. 1. c. 5.</note>

God in mercy with-hold the like Judgment from this Land, both in our dayes, and for ever after us.

the vindication of that Learned Father, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more then otherwiſe would have been needful: yet I have not uſed the Authority of any of them that were members of that moſt Religious <hi>Council,</hi> except onely the ſame <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius.</hi> Indeed <hi>AthanaſiUs</hi> is often mentioned by me, but he was no member there; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were preſent as a Diſputant among many others in the outward porch, yet being then but in the Degree of a <hi>Deacon,</hi> he had no voice, or right of Suffrage in that Council. But if this Doctor under the notion of the <hi>Nicenei Fathers</hi> intendeth a contempt of all thoſe Primitive Doctors, and others, that ſince have adhered to the Decrees of that Council; he muſt thereby diſ-believe the then whole Catholick World: and we with more modeſty, and leſſe liberty profeſſe, we do not believe him, nor his fellowes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That I have beſtowed the more time in the Queſtion of the <hi>viſibility of God,</hi> becauſe this Doctor doth very prophanely ſlight that great myſterious apparition of God to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in the ſhape of <hi>three men;</hi> which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:115436:7"/>
to the <hi>Eternal Covenant of Grace</hi> before the Creation, Three Perſons were neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, (as is ſhewed in the Preface of this Book) ſo now, becauſe the ſame Covenant was renewed with <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was, new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly circumciſed; it pleaſed the Divine Wiſdom to exhibit a glimpſe of the ſame <hi>Bleſſed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> As alſo again in the Goſpel, when our bleſſed Saviour was Incarnate, and then Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and Baptized, (which Sacraments were a new Sealing of the ſame Covenant) there was a manifeſtation of the <hi>Three Perſons,</hi>

            <p n="4">4. That I have ſo largely endeavoured the Expoſition of thoſe hard places, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. becauſe the Commenter hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them over very ſlightly; although the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties therein might well buſie a Doctoral pen and brain: But I conceive, he knew, that a true, and ſound Expoſition, would ſpoil his deſign, of picking <hi>Socianiſme</hi> out of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That the Reader is not to expect Anſwers to Arguments againſt the Divinity of Chriſt, becauſe the Doctor uſeth none at all, but onely his own magiſterial affirmation without proof; and if he had proceeded by way of Argument, he could not have uſed ſtronger, then had been before publiſhed in print by the ſaid <hi>Joh.

            <p n="6">
               <pb facs="tcp:115436:8"/>6. That, whereas in my firſt Book, and tenth Chapter, I have affirmed, <hi>The Article of Chriſt's Deſcent into hell,</hi> not to have been mentioned in any <hi>Creed</hi> generally received, till after the dayes of St. <hi>Austin;</hi> I am ſtill of the ſame mind: Although I confeſſe that this Article is mentioned in that large <hi>Symbole,</hi> which is rehearſed in the ninth Tome, in the book called <hi>Soliloquia,</hi> Chap. 32. And alſo in<note place="margin">Aug. Soliloq. cap. 32. To. 9. De Temp. Ser. 115. To. 10.</note> the 10. Tome, <hi>Serm. 115. De Tempore,</hi> and there aſſerted, as if it were caſt into the Creed by St. <hi>Thomas the Apoſtle.</hi> My anſwer is, That thoſe writings were not <hi>Auſtin's</hi> own, but <hi>Suppoſititious,</hi> and pinned on him by later Writers, as is well known and proved by Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men; Becauſe the ſame Father in his book <hi>De Fide, &amp; Symbolo</hi> (which is undoubtedly<note place="margin">Aug. De Fide &amp; ſymb. To. 3.</note> his own) diſputeth quite through that <hi>Creed</hi> which was then called the <hi>Apoſtles Creed;</hi> and this, in the Preſence of a <hi>grand Council of all Africk at Hippo,</hi> yet maketh no mention at all of Chriſt's Deſcent. And although it be true, that the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſts deſcent into Hell,</hi> is by the ſame Father very often aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted as <hi>Catholick;</hi> notwithſtanding (as I ſaid) it was not in his time inſerted into the Creed.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That, whereas in my fourth Book, and 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chapter, I have ſaid, That no old, or new <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> did ever to my remembrance aſſert <hi>two Baptiſmes,</hi> except onely <hi>Marcion:</hi> Now, ſince the writing thereof (which was finiſhed <hi>Anno</hi> 1647.) Two Engliſh Books came to my hands, one printed, 1646. affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb facs="tcp:115436:8"/>
that Baptiſme may be oft adminiſtred, as well as the Word may be oft preached to one and the ſame perſon. The other book prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 1638, very modeſtly, and under Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection affirmeth, That, Not Scripture, but the Practice and <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Ancient Church, is the Onely ground whereby we are reſtrained from twice Baptizing the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But I truſt, that the godly Reader will be otherwiſe perſwaded, when he hath peruſed the Expoſition of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. which beginneth at the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chapter of my 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Book.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That my deſign in penning this Book, was both to diſcover the great and dangerous Hereſies lurking in that Commentary; And alſo in my way, to open and ſet forth the very foundations of Chriſtian Religion, and to give what ſatisfaction I could, to ſcrupulous men, in the Doctrines, and Diſciplines of this Church. Which hath been my practice both in my private, and publick Labours for many years; Eſpecially in theſe our later <hi>Sceptick, and Zetetick dayes of New-light;</hi> wherein we have many <hi>Seekers,</hi> that will never find what they pretend to. <hi>Optatus</hi> thus writeth of the<note place="margin">Optat. lib. 6.</note>

            </p>
            <p n="9">9. In the laſt place the Reader is deſired to foreknow, That in this Book we affirm <hi>Jeſus Chriſt to be the Supream, or moſt high God; The
<pb facs="tcp:115436:9"/>
Jehova,</hi> and <hi>the Only God:</hi> But with this <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> That albeit we confidently affirm him to be the <hi>Only God,</hi> yet we ſay not, that <hi>Only Jeſus Chriſt is God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for thereby we ſhould impiouſly deny the gracious, and comfortable Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity of Perſons in the Godhead.</hi> We therefore acknowledge, that the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as Son, are alſo the moſt high<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Onely God; ſo that not onely the Father, nor only the Son, nor only the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, are the Supream God; But that <hi>All, and every one of them, are but One, Onely, moſt high God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have no more to premiſe, but to pray, that God would give to the <hi>Reader</hi> the knowledge and love of his truth. And to the <hi>Author, or Tranſlator</hi> of that Commentary, I tender the advice of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>

The devout man St. <hi>Bernard</hi> was much troubled with the hereſies of <hi>Petrus Abailardus,</hi> who I think was a principal Patriarch of the now Socinian

It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by <hi>Paulus Oroſius, That when the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Indeed, St. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth, that <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 20.</note> 
               <hi>To the Jewes he became as a Jew, and to the Gentiles as one without Law.</hi> But this was a compliance <note n="d" place="margin">Compatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, non men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiendo, <hi>Aug.</hi>

The like he did with the Gentiles, he converſed with them, and did eat with them, and cited their own Writers;
<pb facs="tcp:115436:10"/>
but we find not that ever he ſacrificed to their Idols. In our dayes a Lecture is ſet up for the Converſion of the Jewes, (as is ſaid) and for an harmleſſe compliance with them, it is performed on the Jewiſh Sabbath (our Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day); but we are weil perſwaded, that none of the Lecturers will ſo far temporize with Jews, as to deny the <hi>Eternal Godhead of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> or teach, That the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is not yet come, or blaſpheme the ever bleſſed and <hi>holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> which is the <hi>Character</hi> by which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are diſcerned from Jewes and Turks, who with us confeſſe the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> but will not believe <hi>ae plurality of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons therein.</hi> In which unchriſtian errour the Socinian agreeth with the Jew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titrinitarian</hi> doctrine is the <hi>Cracovian Leaven,</hi> wherewith this new Commentary on the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> is Leavened.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons why the Church-Catholick hath conſtantly held faſt the doctrine of the moſt holy Trinity, are weighty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the evidence, and authority of holy Scripture, which would be too long to inſiſt on here, it being clearly declared by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many Theological Writers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To refute the Heathens cavill againſt the Unity of the Godhead; for they could not conceive, how there could be but one God from Eternity; and yet that this one God ſhould not be ſolitary; which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion muſt needs take place, except we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this myſterious doctrine of a <hi>Perſonal plurality in the ſubſtantial <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of God;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:115436:11"/>
to avoid this ſadneſſe of ſolitude, they fanſied a plurality of Gods; for as God ſaid, <hi>It is not good that man ſhould be alone,</hi> ſo man on his own behalf may truly affirm, (as Biſhop <hi>Goodman</hi> hath obſerved) <hi>It is not good that God ſhould be alone,</hi> as will appear in the reaſon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe this doctrine of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> is the main and prime foundation of mans <hi>Redemption, Juſtification, and Salvation</hi> by the Son of God, which we believe, and hope, and expect, by vertue of that moſt gracious <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> made between God the Father, and God the Son; and ſecretly tranſacted between them before the Creation. Which Covenant is called, <note n="a" place="margin">Epheſ. 3. 11.</note> 
               <hi>The eternal purpoſe of God;</hi> and <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 13. 20.</note> 
               <hi>The everlaſting Covenant;</hi> and <note n="c" place="margin">Rev. 14. 6.</note> 
               <hi>The Eternal Gospel,</hi> and muſt needs be meant in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, where mention is made of <note n="d" place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Electing us in Chriſt before the foundation of the World:</hi> and of <note n="e" place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Calling us according to his own purpoſe and grace which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the World began:</hi> and of <note n="f" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt ordained (for our Redemption) before the foundation of the World.</hi> Of which there is a full diſcourſe in my <hi>Third Book,</hi> and <hi>eighth Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Covenant</hi> doth neceſſarily imply a plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of perſons in the Godhead; <hi>One, to require,</hi> and injoyn; <hi>another, to reſtipulate;</hi> and (which is requiſite in all Covenants) a <hi>third Perſon</hi> diſtinct from the Contractors, as a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-by, and <hi>Witneſſe</hi> thereof: So in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Firſt,</hi> God the Father requireth obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb facs="tcp:115436:11"/>
upon pain of death. <hi>Secondly,</hi> God the Son undertaketh for man's performance, or penalty, or both. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God the Holy-Ghoſt is witneſſe between the Father, and the Son: for oftentimes in Scripture we read of <hi>the Spirit bearing witneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For though the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all ſaid to bear witneſſe for our aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; as, <note n="g" place="margin">Joh. 8. 18.</note> 
               <hi>I am one that bear witneſſe of my ſelf, and my Father that ſent me:</hi> and, <note n="h" place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 7.</note> 
               <hi>There are three that bear witneſſe in heaven:</hi> and, <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 8. 16.</note> 
               <hi>The Spirit beareth witneſſe with our Spirit:</hi> But before the Creation, who could be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe between the Father, and the Son, ſave onely the Eternal Spirit of the Father, and the Son?</p>
            <p>Nor can it be imagined that this Covenant, and reſtipulation could be enacted by One ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Perſon; for the Law-giver muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a Soveraign onely; and the perſons upon whom the Law is impoſed, are as ſubjects: ſo it will be diſſonant from right reaſon, to faſten the Legiſlation, and ſubjection upon the ſelf-ſame perſon.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſing the Law made, and the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty determined and ſet down; it cannot be denyed, that the Supream Law-giver hath naturally and abſolutely a power of relaxation, and diſpenſation, ſo that he may remit the puniſhment for breach of his own Law, and of meer grace without any ſatisfaction, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the offender; but if the ſaid Law-giver do decree, and by his Word bind himſelf to puniſh the offender; (<hi>as he did when he ſaid,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:115436:12"/>
               <note n="k" place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.</note> 
               <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely dye</hi>) hereby he doth confine and reſtrain himſelf from uſing the Imperial prerogative of free pardon, which otherwiſe he might have granted: and hence it is that a Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt needs be exacted, <hi>neceſſitate hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> as <hi>Divines</hi> ſay, upon ſuppoſal of the ſaid decree; and upon this reaſon Jeſus Chriſt our Surety becomes liable to his dreadfull Paſſion and death.</p>
            <p>Touching the Paſſion of Chriſt in Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Gods Juſtice for the ſins of men, the <hi>Socinian Writers</hi> do utterly deny it, as being unjuſt to puniſh one for another, and eſpecially an innocent for a malefactor; and they call this doctrine of Chriſt's ſatisfaction, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> reporteth, <note n="l" place="margin">Ger.

               <hi>God judgeth according to every mans work.</hi> The Anſwer hereunto uſually given, is; That becauſe God doth actually puniſh one for another, it muſt needs be juſt, becauſe God doth it: but this anſwer doth not ſatisfie the Adverſary, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it (I confeſſe) ſatisfie me; for God doth not ſo. Therefore for the better ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of my ſelf in this weighty queſtion,
<pb facs="tcp:115436:12"/>
and perhaps of others alſo, I offer to the conſideration of the Learned Reader theſe two Propoſitions following:</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The Paſſion of Chriſt neither is, nor ought to be accounted the puniſhment of one for another; but the ſame that offended, the ſame is puniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The ſins of the elect Members of Chriſt, are not to be accounted onely the ſins of the Elect, but are juſtly charged on the ſcore of Jeſus Chriſt, being their Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Redeemer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two Propoſitions may perhaps ſeem at firſt <hi>Paradoxical,</hi> but I truſt I ſhall prove them to be truly <hi>Catholick,</hi> and <hi>Orthodox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>firſt, That Chriſt's Sufferings are</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Propoſition.</note> 
               <hi>not the puniſhment of one for another;</hi> I have learned from St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Bernard. Epiſt. 190.</note> 
               <hi>Omnium peccata unus portavit, nec alter jam inveniatur qui forefecit, alter qui ſatisfecit, quia caput &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus unus eſt Chriſtus, ſatisfecit caput pro mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris;</hi> (i.) <hi>One bare the ſins of all, ſo that we cannot ſay, One forfeited, and another ſatisfied, becauſe the head and body are but one Chriſt, the head ſatisfied for the members.</hi> So the <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> and <hi>Wife</hi> are but one perſon in Law, an action of debt is not brought againſt the wife, but the husband: ſo the <hi>principal debtor, and the Surety</hi> are in Law but one perſon, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them are liable to payment or penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>This firſt Propoſition is grounded on the doctrine of Chriſt's <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> and conjunction with his members: which <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> is of ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:115436:13"/>
weighty concernment, that without it, it is impoſſible to ſalve, or unfold the myſterious riddles of Gods operations, and words in the buſineſſe of man's Salvation; and therefore the holy Scriptures and ancient Doctors have with very great abundance of teſtimonies aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this neceſſary truth.

               <hi>Tu Domine Jeſu es juſtitia mea, Ego ſum peccatum tuum:</hi> for if but one member of the body commit an offence, the whole man is chargeable with it.</p>
            <p>This truth is of great concernment to be known; for if Chriſt cannot be truly charged with ſin, how can we poſſibly juſtifie the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Godhead, when it is ſaid, <note n="o" place="margin">Prov. 17. 15.</note> 
               <hi>He that juſtifieth the wicked, and he that condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the juſt; both are abominable to the Lord?</hi> So then, Chriſt muſt be charged with ſin, and man muſt be diſcharged of ſin, or elſe neither Chriſt can juſtly ſuffer puniſhment, nor can man with Juſtice be ſaved. The neglect, or
<pb facs="tcp:115436:16"/>
ignorance of this weighty truth, occaſioned the <hi>Socinian</hi> party to exclaim againſt us, as if we charged God with <hi>tyranny,</hi> in laying the puniſhment due to us offenders, upon our innocent Saviour; which alſo drew from <hi>Brentius</hi> a <hi>Lutheran</hi> this blaſphemy, <hi>Deus</hi>
               <note place="margin">Brent. Exegeſ. in Joh. 19.</note>

            </p>
            <p>The difficulty of this doctrine conſiſteth in two Points: 1. <hi>How Chriſt can be juſtly charged with ſin,</hi> in whom all Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, there was no ſin. 2. <hi>How man can juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be acquitted of ſin,</hi> who (without doubt) never lived one minute without ſin. The truth of both, the Chriſtian Reader may thus appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</p>
            <p>In Chriſt there is a <hi>double capacity,</hi> or <hi>two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold conſideration. Firſt,</hi> as he is in himſelf, a natural body, a private man, or particular perſon, without any relation to us; and ſo no actions of his concern us, or ours him. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> as he is a part of a <hi>corporation Political,</hi> or <hi>body myſtical</hi> before mentioned; (for the head is but a part of the body) in this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, his, and our actions concern us joyntly: for if the hand be wounded, the head will ſay, You hurt me: ſo we read, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 26. If one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it; if one member be honoured, all the members rejoyce with it; now ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular.</hi> If one member of a Corporation do an injury in the
<pb facs="tcp:115436:16"/>
name of the whole, the whole or any one of them ſhall be liable to anſwer for it. If a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration be indebted, any one member paying the debt, ſatisfieth for the whole, and for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular member.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poſthumius a Roman Conſul,</hi> profeſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a Citizen of the <hi>Samnites,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to pick a quarrel with that Common-Wealth, openly in the aſſembly of the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> kickt the Roman Herald, and ſaid, <note n="a" place="margin">Livi. Decad. 1. lib. 9.</note> 
               <hi>I being a member of the Common-wealth of the Samnites, have done publick injury to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fecial, therefore the Romans may juſtly make war upon the Samnites.</hi> Juſt ſo particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this myſtical body have done injuries to God, and are become debtors, ſo that the whole body is ſubject to penalty, but the whole debt and injury is laid upon, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by one, even Chriſt the Head, in the name and behoof of the whole body.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being premiſed, let us next conſider what extent and operation this Union, Conjunction, or Communion of Chriſt and his Members hath, and what effects it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth. Which may appear by the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of the Primitive Chriſtians, twice men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the <hi>Acts,</hi> where it is ſaid, <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 2. 44. and 4. 32.</note> 
               <hi>They that believed had all things common. And they were of one heart, and one ſoul, neither ſaid any of them, that ought was his own, but they had all things common.</hi> So this Union, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Chriſt and his Members doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that which Divines call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (i.) <hi>a mutual communication of properties,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:115436:17"/>
which worketh and extendeth it ſelf ſo far, that the perfections and excellencies which are originally proper and peculiar to the individual Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, are communicated, and truly affirmed of holy men: So likewiſe the infirmities, yea, and the ſins alſo, of ſuch men who are members of Chriſt, are communicated to, and affirmed of, and imputed, and aſcribed to Chriſt, as may be perceived by theſe inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That Chriſts proper perfections are communicated to ſinful man.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells <hi>us,</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt is made unto us wiſdome, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and ſanctification:</hi> which is as much as to ſay, the wiſdome, the righteouſneſſe, and ſanctity: which originally is onely in Chriſt, and not in us; yet it becomes our wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, and holineſſe, becauſe we are One with him. The ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us again, that <note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> 
               <hi>We are made the righteouſneſſe of God in him.</hi> So that man is righteous, onely becauſe Chriſt is ſo, with whom man is united in one body. Thus every true member of Chriſt is called <note n="e" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9. Rev. 1. 6.</note> 
               <hi>a King and a Prieſt;</hi> this is onely becauſe Chriſt is both; and becauſe his members are one with him, therefore they are ſo denominated by his perfections. Upon this ground it is that St. <hi>Hierome</hi> calleth <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Hier. ad Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſ Epiſt. 58. cont. Lucife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.</note> 
               <hi>Sacerdotium Laicum, (i.) a Lay-mans Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> becauſe baptiſme is the Sacrament of our entrance and ingrafting into Chriſt, and ſo of our union with him, which union doth work a communication of his <hi>regality and Prieſthood to us.</hi> So <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, <note n="g" place="margin">Orig. in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. cap. 16. hom. 9.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That our actions and paſſions, our infirmities, yea, and <hi>our ſins alſo are commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to Chriſt, and called his;</hi> may appear by theſe paſſages: Chriſt ſaith, <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> 
               <hi>I was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, I was naked, I was in priſon.</hi>

               <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> when theſe things were not meant of his own proper and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual perſon, but only of his ſervants and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which he calleth himſelf; for ſo he ſaith, <hi>Verily in as much as ye have done it unto one of the leaſt of my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi> So the Apoſtle ſaith, that <note n="c" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt was made ſin for us;</hi> when in the ſame breath it is alſo affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>that he knew no ſin.</hi> Both are moſt true, becauſe our ſins are his ſins, by reaſon of this union, as the debt of the principal, is alſo the debt of the Surety. So Chriſt is ſaid to be <note n="d" place="margin">Rev. 13. 8.</note> 
               <hi>ſlain from the beginning of the world,</hi> even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was incarnate, becauſe of <hi>Abel</hi> who was both his <hi>member, and type. Lyranus</hi> upon that place ſaith, <note n="e" place="margin">Lyra. in loc.</note>

               <hi>where the hand came out of the Womb before the other parts;</hi> yet it was a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber united to the body as well as the other parts.</p>

               <hi>I cry unto thee daily,</hi> or <hi>all the day long;</hi> that is, all the time of the world continuance. If queſtion be made, how this can be true of any one man? <hi>Auſtin</hi>

            <p>Finally, upon theſe grounds, If it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded how any man can be ſaved, ſeeing man daily tranſgreſſeth the Law? Our anſwer is, That every true member of Chriſt doth perfectly perform the Law, in that Chriſt hath done it, who is one with his members. So if we enquire how Chriſt could with Juſtice ſuffer death, who never ſinned? The anſwer is, That his ſuffering was juſt, becauſe the ſins of his Members, or body, are his ſinnes, in that himſelf and his Members are One; for it is as eaſie to conceive our moſt innocent Saviour to be juſtly charged with our ſins, as
<pb facs="tcp:115436:18"/>
to conceive ſinful man to be juſtly diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of all ſin, and to be truly called <hi>righteous,</hi> even the <hi>righteouſneſſe of God in him.</hi>

                           <p>RIght Reverend, and my much honoured Lord, I humbly and heartily thank you for your kind advertiſement, and good counſel; for untill I read your Lordſhips Letter, I knew nothing of the Printing, or publiſhing of this <hi>Comment</hi> on the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, which makes me not a little to wonder, and ſomewhat to ſuſpect ill dealing, in that I ſhould be made (by them that have to deal in it) ſo great a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to it, ſeeing <hi>I Licenced it,</hi> and live in the Town near unto them.

                     <p>THat the ſpringing up of the tares of hereſie, gave occaſion to the Church to enlarge the Creed, thereby endeavouring to extirpate thoſe errours, it may appear by theſe inſtances, whereof ſome are undeniable, and the reſt very probable, and have been ſo thought formerly by <note n="†" place="margin">Eraſm. ad facul.

                     <p n="1">1.

as is ſaid before, becauſe by this article the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of mans ſoul is aſſerted, in that the ſoul of Chriſt is confeſſed to deſcend to the ſame inviſible condition that other dead mens ſoules do.</p>
                     <p>For what greater reaſon can be alledged, or hath hitherto appeared to us mortals, why this article of <hi>Chriſts deſcending into Hades</hi> ſhould be ſo long after other articles received into the Church? or what have we learned more by it then that his ſoul, as other mens, did ſubſiſt during its ſeparation, though in a ſtate and condition which is not yet revealed to us? There was no Creed which was generally received, that had the Article of Chriſts deſcent till after St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin's</hi> time for ought can appear to me; and though St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> oft mentions this Creed which is called Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical, and diſputes it quite through, and before a Council alſo, <note n="a" place="margin">Aug. de fid. &amp; Symb. n. 57.</note> yet never mentions the article of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent: and (beſides that Creed in <hi>Tertullian</hi> before ſet down) neither the <hi>Nicene</hi> hath it, nor was this article anciently in that Creed which we call the <hi>Athanaſian;</hi> nor in the <hi>Symbolical hymn</hi> which goes under the names of <hi>Ambroſe and Auſtin,</hi> though it is ancient, and hath been generally received in the Weſtern Church: nor was this Article in the Confeſſion of the Councill of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> That it was not in the Creed of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> at firſt, hath been declared lately by the renowned <hi>Primate of Ireland;</hi> nor doth it yet ſufficiently appear that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was the writer of it, onely we are ſure that all the doctrinal Articles of that Creed are ſtill to be found in the writings of <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> and there are ſome paſſages in the Fathers and Church-Hiſtories that may incline us to think, that when the Emperor <hi>Jovinian</hi> ſent to <hi>Athanaſius</hi> for an exquiſite draught of the Orthodox faith, <note n="b" place="margin">Theod hiſt. l. 4. c. 4. Ruff. hiſt. l. 2. c. 1. Naz. Orat. 21. in Athan.</note> 
                        <hi>Athanaſius</hi> anſwered, That the <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> was to be obſerved, and withall ſent him (as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> writeth) a <hi>form, or deſcription of his faith;</hi> and ſo alſo ſaith <hi>Nazianzen;</hi> That he ſent it in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which <hi>Nicetos</hi> thinks to be this very Creed. Indeed this article was in the Creed of the Church of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> which <hi>Ruffinus</hi> expounded; and alſo in ſome <hi>Arian Creeds,</hi> before the death of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> but not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved generally till after his death, as is ſaid before, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115436:35"/>
therefore I think it very probable, that as other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies occaſioned other new articles to be added (as is ſhew'n) ſo this <hi>Arabick hereſie</hi> occaſioned this <hi>article of deſcent.</hi>

                     <p>Now that it may appear, that errours, hereſies, and ſects were the cauſes of, not onely new articles, but of a multiplying of new Symbols, Confeſſions and Creeds, the Fathers and Hiſtories do evidently declare; for in the dayes of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Valens,</hi> both <hi>Arian</hi> Emperors, when every <hi>Sect</hi> of Religion was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated except onely the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and they onely were perſecuted, whereof St. <hi>Baſil</hi> complained, who<note place="margin">Baſil.

Euſeb. Auſtin,</hi> and others, which having but touched, I omit, to avoid digreſſions.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt difficulty in this queſtion, is, what our Saviour meant by the words, (<hi>holy Spirit, or holy Ghoſt</hi>) when he ſaid, <hi>The blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven:</hi> for the underſtanding whereof, I will lay down a few Conſiderations to the Reader, that from them he may gather the true meaning of that hard ſaying.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That in Chriſt there are two natures, 1. His Godhead or Divine nature, by which he is called <hi>God over all bleſſed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9. 5. 2. His humane nature, or manhood, made of the ſeed of <hi>David, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 1. 3. The firſt of theſe is called <hi>Forma Dei;</hi> the ſecond is called <hi>forma Servi,</hi> both are<note place="margin">Philip. 2. 6, 7.</note> mentioned, <hi>Philip. 2. 6. Who being in the</hi> form of God; <hi>thought it no robbery to be equal to God, but made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the</hi> form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Conſider, that there are <hi>two ſpirits</hi> in Chriſt; 1. His ſoul or humane ſpirit, of which he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115436:52"/>
ſaith, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit,</hi> Luk. 23. 46. Secondly, his Divine Spirit, of which it is ſaid, <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is noni of his,</hi> Rom. 8. 9.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that (according to his two natures) there are two filiations in Chriſt; for, 1. He is called the <hi>Son of man,</hi> the ſon of <hi>David.</hi> 2. He is called the <hi>Son of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That (according to thoſe two natures, two ſpirits, and two ſonſhips) the Scripture mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth two kinds of blaſphemies againſt Chriſt, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>FOr the right underſtanding of this queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Reader to take notice of theſe few obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations following.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That this Phariſaciall blaſphemy was uttered, and intended onely againſt the Perſon of Chriſt, and therein onely againſt his Godhead, and therefore the anſwer of Chriſt muſt needs be a Vindication of his Perſon, and of his Godhead, for otherwiſe Chriſt might ſeem not to have anſwered punctually, to the ſlander and blaſphemy objected, if we ſhall confeſs that the blaſphemy was againſt the Perſon of the Son, and yet imagine that his anſwer is onely concerning another Perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> the Perſon of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Obſerve again, that Chriſt doth not there make any mention of the blaſphemy againſt the Perſon of the Father, (though there was as much reaſon that he ſhould as to mention a blaſphemy againſt the third Perſon.) But he keeps himſelf punctually to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon himſelf, againſt whom onely this blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie was ſpoken, and intended, neither did he at this time go abour to aſſert and vindicate the honour either of the Perſon of the Father, or of the Perſon of the holy Ghoſt, againſt which Perſons, nothing was expreſly ſaid, or meant; but be did onely declare the power and Truth of his own Godhead in his own Perſon, and therefore he ſaid, <hi>If I caſt out divels by the Spirit of God, the k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:115436:54"/>3. Thirdly, obſerve, that as in his Arguments he ſpake onely of his own Perſon, like a good diſputant, confining himſelf exactly <hi>ad idem,</hi> to the ſame thing the Phariſees ſpake of; ſo in his anſwer, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing judgement againſt thoſe blaſphemers, by the rule of right reaſon he muſt ſtill continue his ſpeech of the ſame Perſon; therefore in effect he ſaith thus: <hi>Although a word ſpoken againſt me as I am a man, and the Son of man may be forgiven; yet a blaſphemy or word ſpoken againſt me as I am very God, cannot be forgiven.</hi> Or thus, The villifying, depraving blaſpheming, or ſpeaking againſt my humane nature, may be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but the depraving, denying, or blaſpheming my Godhead, my divine Nature, my divine and holy Spirit, ſhall not be forgiven.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Obſerve again, that the Jewes had indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved him in both his Natures. 1. In his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood thus, <hi>Behold, a glutton, a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and ſinners?</hi> Matth. 11. 19. and afterwards, <hi>Is not this the Carpenters ſon?</hi> Matth. 13. 55. diſparaging him for his mean parentage: this is the Expoſition of St. <hi>Amb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To ſin againſt the Son of Man, is to conceive too baſely of the fleſh of Chriſt;—and they that ſo ſin, are not utterly excluded from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. 2. The Jewes blaſphemed him now in his Godhead, by denying it, and aſcribing the miracle to confederacy with <hi>Beelzebub;</hi> and of this blaſphemy, which doth take away the very foundation of remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins, it is ſaid, It ſhall not be forgiven.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I may adde hereunto that thoſe unbaptized Phariſees in probability, did not intend any obloquy or blaſphemy againſt the Perſon of the holy Spirit as it is the third Perſon; of which they had never been inſtructed, neither had they ſo much Chriſtianity as thoſe diſciples at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> who though they had been baptized unto <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiſme, yet they had not ſo much as <hi>heard whether there be an holy Ghoſt.</hi> Act. 19. 2.</p>
                     <p>Thus having ſhewed that in Scripture, and in the writings of the Fathers and later Divines, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt is called a Spirit, and holy, and alſo an holy Spirit, and that in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> thoſe words,

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the hypoſtaticall union of the Godhead and manhood in the Perſon of Jeſus Christ, the communication of the properties of each na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the life and death of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and how Chriſt is ſaid to be deified</head>
                     <p>FOr the avoyding of the unpardonable ſin before mentioned, it will not be ſufficient to believe and confeſs that God is in Jeſus as a man in a ſhip, or as God was in the Prophets, and is now in holy men, who are therefore called <hi>the Temples of the living God, 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 16. or as God is every where, <hi>who filleth hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, Jer.</hi> 23. 24. For though God be in an holy Man, yet we cannot ſay, that God and that Man are one Perſon, and though God be in Heaven, yet he and Heaven are not one hypoſtaſis, or ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence in one Perſonall union: but as our ſoul and body united and compoſed are one Man, and one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo the Godhead and Manhood united in Ieſus, are one Perſon, one Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe two diſtinct natures, to wit, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and Manhood, are in Chriſt ſo united, that they will be for ever inſeparable; and they are ſo entwined one with the other, that no action or paſſion can be ſaid of the man Chriſt, which may not be ſaid of God; the rule of Divines is, <hi>Eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>propria naturarum,</hi> (i.) By reaſon of this hypoſtaricall union, thoſe things which are proper to each nature ſeverally, become common to the whole perſon: and hence it is that Chriſt is called the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> and the <hi>Son of God; eternall,</hi> and yet <hi>born</hi> the on of <hi>David,</hi> and yet the <hi>Lord of David:</hi> of him it is ſaid, John 3. 13. <hi>He that came down from Heaven, even the Son of Man which is in Heauen:</hi>] yet the Manhood did not come from heaven, nor was the Manhood at that time in Heaven; ſo again, Chriſt ſaid to the thief, Luke 23. 43. <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe,</hi> and yet Chriſt was not there that day in his body, nor by his ſoul, (for ought we know) but onely by his Godhead, which was then in Paradiſe when his body was on the earth; and hence it is that the appellation of God is ſtamped on the humane and infirm actions and paſſions of Chriſt; for though he was <hi>crucified through weakneſſe, as it is ſaid,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 4. that is, as he was man, yet becauſe his Divine Nature is for ever inſeparable from the humane nature, he is truely called <hi>Deus crucifixus,</hi>

                     <p>1 For anſwer hereunto, I ſay firſt, that Chriſts delivering up the Kingdome to the Father, doth not imply any reſignation or annulling of his own intereſt, nor excluding of himſelf, or abdicating his own domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but a communication of that power which he received (as he was man) to his Father, who is the ſame God with him.

                        <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> The Godhead of Chriſt further proved from the typicall Tabernacle and Temple.</head>
                     <p>IT will not be impertinent to this buſineſs in hand, to inquire why God confined the Jewiſh worſhip to the Tabernacle and Temple, as it is manifeſt he did; for, <hi>Levit.</hi> 17. 3, 4. the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are required upon pain of death to bring their ſacrifices to the doore of the Tabernacle. So the publick Paſſeover is to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed onely in the <hi>place which the Lord ſhall chuſe, Deut.</hi> 12. 5. and what place that is, we finde ſet down, 2 <hi>Sam. 7. 13. The houſe that</hi> Solomon <hi>the ſonne of</hi> David <hi>ſhall build;</hi> and this building was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by him, 1 <hi>King</hi> 8. 20. and God declared his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of that Houſe or Temple, 2 <hi>Chron. 7. 12. The Lord appeared to</hi> Solomon,—<hi>and ſaid unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have choſen this place to my ſelf, for an houſe of ſacrifice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the reaſon why the Iſraelites were confined to perform their worſhip in this place, was, becauſe God would keep them in a perpetuall memory and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the <hi>Meſſiah to be incarnate;</hi> of whole incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation both the Tabernacle and the Temple were but Figures or Types: <hi>Templum erat figura Corporis Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minici,</hi>

                     <p>So in effect, the Object of the Iſraelaticall worſhip was God preſent in his Temple, thereby feeding their faith in the promiſed Meſſiah, who was afterwards to reſide in his Tabernacle of the humane nature. So that the ultimate Object of their adoration, was the Sonne of God: God incarnate, even the ſame God, whom we Chriſtians now worſhip.

                     <p>For all Prayer is directed to God onely, but not to the Father onely; and becauſe the Godhead is in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Perſon, ſo that every Perſon is God; therefore Prayer may be made to any Perſon and Chriſt will yet ſtill continue our Mediatour, both to the Father, and to the Holy Ghoſt, and to himſelf alſo; for he that prayeth to one Perſon, prayeth to all three Perſons, for they are all inſeparately involvd one in another. <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in me, &amp; I am in him,</hi> Joh. 14. 11. and <hi>the Father and I are one,</hi> Joh. 10. 30.

for onely one is the Father of the Son of God: but in that he ſaith, <hi>The Father,</hi> he doth not debar us from praying to the other Perſons, becauſe (as hath been ſhewed out of <hi>Eſay</hi> 9. 6.) every Perſon is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Father, becauſe every one is one God.</p>
                     <p>There is but one God in the three Perſons, and that one God, the ſecond Perſon (being God Incarnate) is our Mediatour; and though he be Mediatour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Incarnate; yet neither his Mediatourſhip, nor his Incarnation do nullifie his Godhead, ſo that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is Mediatour for us to himſelf, to his own God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; ſo that we may pray to the Son, to hear us for his own ſake.

                     <p>For anſwer hereunto, we are to underſtand that God is in another manner exiſtent in holy men and other creatures, then he is exiſtent in the humane nature of Chriſt, (as is ſhewed before, chap 8) For the Godhead and Manhood in Chriſt, are one Perſon, but not ſo in other creatures; God dwelleth in a Saint, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 16. yet you cannot ſay that God and the Saint are one perſon; for if ſo, then that Saint muſt be called God, and ſhould be worſhipped as God; but we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs<note place="margin">Hier. cont.

                        </gap>eſus Chriſt hath been ſaid to be that grand unpardonable ſin, and therefore what great cauſe and reaſon we have to be rightly inſtructed in, and to be frequently put in mind of this weighty Doctrine, becauſe if Jeſus be not the true, and onely, and moſt high God, and be not ſo by us confeſſed, and believed; we can obtain no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, but muſt neceſſarily periſh everlaſtingly.</p>
                     <p>In this Confeſſion therefore I ſet up my reſt, and to him in this Faith I faſten my ſoul, for all my hope of ſalvation is included in this Doctrine, which if it ſhould prove untrue, I might with trembling ſay as an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then did on his death-bead,</p>

                     <p>I anſwer, that after the Creation, God the Son en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the ſame Covenant wirh Man, that he had ingaged himſelf in, to the Father before the Creation, and by this, renuing the ſame Covenant, he bound Mankind to himſelf, as himſelf had bin bound before to the Father, and that divers and ſundry times. For firſt, the words of the Covenant between God and the Son, and Mankind before the fall were theſe:</p>
                     <p>Gen. 2. 17. <hi>Of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evill, thou ſhalt not eat of it, for in the day thou eateſt, thou ſhall ſurely die.</hi>] In this Covenant on Gods part life is promiſed implicitely, and on mans part, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is reftipulated or covenanted, for to this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Man had ſubmitted, and given conſent as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 3. So that this was a perfect Covenant on both ſides, the <hi>Tree of Knowledge</hi> ſtanding as a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible figne for mans obedience; and the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> as a Sacramentall ſign of Gods promiſe.</p>
                     <p>But after the fall of Man, the ſame God did again more evidently, and particularly ingage himſelf when he ſaid of the ſeed of the woman, Gen. 3. 15. <hi>It ſhall</hi>

In this promiſe the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God in the ſeed of the woman was meant, and that therein he ſhould take upon him the curſe, and death formetly denounced; by offering himſelf a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſin, the outward ſigns of this Covenant were the ſacrifices, wherewith the Patriarks did ſignifie and nouriſh their faith in that promiſe.</p>
                     <p>3. After this the ſame Covenant was again renued to <hi>Abraham</hi> more particularly, Gen. 12. 3. <hi>In thee ſhall all Families of the earth be bleſſed,</hi> &amp;c.] and then came in the Sacrament of <hi>Circumciſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4 After this again, the ſame Covenant was more largely given to, and publiſhed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Law Morall containing Mans duty, and in the Law <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall,</hi> declaring Gods promiſe of Redemption, by the Figures, Types, ſigns and ſhadowes of Tabernacle, Prieſt, and ſacrifices.</p>
                     <p>5 After this again, the ſame Covenant was more clearly delivered in the Goſpel, by the ſame Lord God, and moſt graciouſly explained, and the vail taken off from it; for then it was ſhewed, who was that <hi>ſeed of the woman,</hi> and that <hi>ſeed of Abraham,</hi> and that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; &amp; <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> which ſhould take away the ſins of the world, and how man ſhould be enabled to perform the Covenant and Law of his God, namely, in that Chriſt his ſurety ſhould perform all in mans behalf, with this condition onely required of man, to believe in this Jeſus his God and Saviour; for ſo the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Covenant declareth, John 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believed in him, ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi>] And again, Mark 16. 16. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſav'd, but he that believeth not, ſhall be damned.</hi>] This is the one, and onely, and everlaſting Covenant of Grace; there are not two Covenants, but onely this one both before, and ſince the world began.</p>
                     <p>Now if any man ask why there is mention of a <hi>new Covenant?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, it is called a new Covenant; becauſe the old Covenant is renued; juſt as we ſay there is a new

Chriſt in the New Teſtament is the ſame with <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in the Old Teſtament. We may as well ſay, that the Sun-riſing is a new Sunne, which being but one, and riſing dayly, and diverſly<note place="margin">Catul. car. 5. Virg.

                     <p>For, the ſame Covenant which before was clouded with obſcurity, and with Types in the time of the Law, ſhineth brightly in the time of the Goſpel. But why then do Divines call this Law-Covenant, the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works,</hi> whereas the Goſple-Covenant is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Covenant of Grace?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that this one Covenant is both, for if the Law of God be not actually and perfectly done and performed by man, <hi>viz</hi> either by us our ſelves, or by Chriſt, or ſurety for us, we can have no benefit by the Covenant: ſo in reſpect of Chriſt, it is a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works,</hi> but to us, it is a <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it may be ſaid, that the Evangelicall Covenant is called a <hi>better Covenant,</hi> Heb. 8. 6.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, the ſame Covenant is called <hi>better,</hi> becauſe it is bettered, and better explained, and ſetforth with better evidence of graciouſneſſe in the Goſpel, then before, when in the time of the Law it was clouded, and clogged with ſhadows, types, figures, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Ceremonies, but now it ſhineth clearly, and is alſo quitted of that heavy yoak, then it outwardly appeared; but as <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, (i.) a <hi>Teſtament;</hi> and albeit the Law is alſo called a <hi>Teſtament,</hi> yet it is but as the Will or Teſtament of a man, which is indeed written and ſealed, and teſtified, but not in force, becauſe the <hi>Teſtater</hi> was not actually dead.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:115436:115"/>But in the Goſpel this Old Teſtament (being the ſame in ſubſtance) is newly become to be in full force and vertue, becauſe <hi>Ieſus Chriſt the Teſtator died,</hi> Heb. 9. 17. ſo it became in force; for Chriſt who was but promiſed in the time of the Law, and died there but in types, was really exhibited, and really died in the Goſpel; and although the Evangelicall Teſtament is ſet forth with a condition annexed, <hi>viz</hi> of believing; yet this condition is alſo in this New Teſtament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed; for Eph. 2. 8, <hi>Faith is the gift of God,</hi> and yet Faith is that Law of which it is ſaid, Jer. 31. 33. <hi>I will put my Law in their inward pares, and write it in their hearts;</hi> and the ſame is repeated, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. So the new Teſtament requireth the condition of believing, and the <hi>Teſtator</hi> in his Will, hath given to man what he requireth of man. The brief of all is, that the ſame God who in Paradiſe ingaged himſelf, that <hi>the ſeed of the woman, ſhould bruiſe the Serpents head,</hi> hath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf taken upon him the ſeed of the woman, and in that ſeed became our Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>If after all this, the Chriſtian ſhall yet deſire further evidence, to inform him more, and aſſure and confirm him in Chriſts ingagement and ſuretyſhip for us men; as if his Word, Promiſe and Covenant, weee not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to give reſt and contentment, to our wavering and timerous hearts: ſee how our moſt compaſſionate and merciful Redeemer hath yet further condeſcended, not onely to enter a covenant in our behalf, but alſo to ſeal the ſaid Covenant, and thereby openly declare himſelf to be a debtor with us, both for the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall; that is, the fulfilling of the Law, and alſo for the penalty.</p>
                     <p>1 Upon our default and tranſgreſſion, and this he did by the firſt ſeal of his Circumciſion, whereby he bound himſelf as a debtor to perform the whole Law; and this in behalf of all the circumciſed ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> and this Myſtery is clearly ſet forth by the great Apoſtle, Gal. 5. 3. For <hi>I teſtifie again to every man that is circumciſed, that he is a debtour to doe the whole Law.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as by the ſeal of Circumciſion, Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent

the burthen of all the legall precepts: So by the other <hi>Seal of his Baptiſme,</hi> he undertook the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all the ſtrict Evangelicall Precepts, in the behalf of all the Baptized Chriſtians; for ſo himſelf declared, though ſomething covertly: for when <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> refuſed to baptize him, Chriſt bade him, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> 3. 15. adding this reaſon—<hi>For thus it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh us to fulfill all righteouſneſſe.</hi>] Upon which words Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> obſerves that he did not ſay,<note place="margin">Hier. in loc.</note>

                     <p>Finally, all that Chriſt did undertake to doe for us men, that hath he punctually performed, partly by his <hi>Obedience active</hi> in fulfilling all righteouſneſſe, and partly by <hi>paſſive Obedience,</hi> when he ſuffered the penalty of our tranſgreſſions, pouring out his ſoul, and his moſt precious Blood upon the Croſſe, there pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the utmoſt farthing of our debt, when our ſelves were not able to pay one for a thouſand.</p>

And what ſeperation can be meant, but only, that Chriſt was conceived in a way diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and <hi>Seperate</hi> from ordinarie Conceptions? And that is, miraculouſly, by the operation of the Holy ghoſt without man; and this I take to be the meaning of the Apoſtle before alleaged Heb. 7. 26: <hi>That our high-Preiſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115436:122"/>
muſt be ſeperate from ſinners.</hi> For to Imagine that the Holy ghoſt did take away carnal pollution from that part of the Virgin mother of which Chriſt was made fleſh, and yet left the ſaid Original pollution remaining in the other parts of her, to me it ſeemes both an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, and a needleſs refuge to this queſtion. And whether God doth any time take away the pollution of Original ſin from any perſon, in whom it once was, during this mortal life, I have at large ſhewed before, <hi>in my ſecond book and tenth Chapter,</hi> and that the taking<note place="margin">See before. l. 2. c. 10. ſect. 2. 2 Cor. 12. 8.</note> away of Original ſin, was that very thing which S. <hi>Paul</hi> prayed for ſo earneſtly, and had only this anſwer. <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi>

                           <p>Finally, becauſe the firſt man was made of earth; and the firſt woman was made of man, and both before luſt was hatched, therfore both were at firſt free from this Original pollution, upon which conſideration <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi>

                     <p>BUt in the ſecond place it would be inquired, what Intereſt the unregenerate man hath in Chriſt, &amp; how he can lay any claime to Chriſts ſufferings, for although it be true that Chriſt hath taken the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man's nature on him, yet, may wee, or can we truly ſay that the unregenerate man hath received the Spirit of Chriſt into him? If this will not be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Chriſt cannot be a perſon idoneous, or fitly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to be his redeemer, becauſe as ſuch a redeemer muſt take ſomthing from man, ſo man muſt alſo receive ſomthing from him, that by giving and taking the redeemer and redeemed may be united, and ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as one bodie, and that muſt be by receiving the Spirit from Chriſt, as Chriſt received fleſh from man, which is elegantlie expreſſed by Proſper in his poem. <hi>

Now it ſeemeth that the Spirit of Chriſt is alſo communicated to the unregenerate man, becauſe wee find in Scripture that he alſo hath an intereſt in Chriſt, and a claime and title to him; for the Scripture declareth that the benefit of Chriſt's death, and by it redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is offered to all men of what condition ſoever, whether good, or bad, regenerate, or unregenerate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, or unbeleevers; for the Goſpel is ſent to all the world, and to every creature <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 15. and One of the maine points of the Goſpel, is the offer of the benefit of redemption by the death of Chriſt, of which the Scripture ſaith 2 Cor. 5. 15. <hi>that he died for all,</hi> ſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. &amp; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. and againe <hi>Heb. 2. 9.

(i) Chriſt died for his enemies, for tyrant-perſecutors, for witches and conjurers for thoſe that hated him, for thoſe that crucified him, and for thoſe whom he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw, before the world, that they would be ſuch, yet his foreknowledge did not hinder his goodnes toward them, but that he offered to them the benefit of his death. Now if yet any man deſire to know upon what ground the unregenerate man can lay claim to any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by Chriſt. I anſwer, that the reaſon and ground of this claime is becauſe the unregenerate mans nature is taken into Chriſt, as well as the regenerate mans, and I ſay moreover, that the Spirit of Chriſt is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the unregenerate man, as truly as it is to the regenerate man, although with a great deale of diverſitie in operation as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter.</p>
                     <p>That the Spirit of God, (which is the ſpirit of Chriſt) is communicated to men unregenerate, the Scripture evidently declareth; for if the <hi>Spirit of God doe fill hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth as the Prophet Jeremie ſaith.

                     <p>That ſeeing the Chriſtian World Catholick, hath ever confeſſed that the Son of God received his fleſh and blood by propagation from the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> It would be now inquired, <hi>whence</hi> the ſame Son of God <hi>had his reaſonable or humane Soul?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reaſon which moved me to make this inquiry, is taken from the Arguments, which divers of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers uſed againſt ſome Hereticks, particularly againſt <hi>Valentinus,</hi> and his <hi>Gnoſtick</hi> followers, and againſt the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and <hi>Eutyches,</hi> for theſe taught, that Chriſt did not receive his Body by traduction from the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Mother, and ſo not from <hi>Adam,</hi> but that it was either from heaven, or elſe that it was a mere appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition, and a phantaſticall body: which Hereſies are ſo well known to men learned, that I ſhall not need to ſend the Reader by Quotations to Fathers to finde them.</p>
                     <p>The Arguments which the Fathers uſed againſt thoſe Hereticks, were to this purpoſe, that they might ſhew a neceſſity, that the Redeemer muſt needs take his fleſh from <hi>Adam.</hi>

The ſame Father, for the probability of propagation of ſouls from <hi>Adam,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth many reaſons.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, writing to Saint <hi>Hierome, Tell me</hi> (ſaith<note place="margin">Id Epiſt. 28.</note> he) <hi>if Soules are doyly created,</hi> and not tranſmitted from the Parents, <hi>wherein have poore Infants ſinned?</hi> and how are they involved in the ſins of <hi>Adam,</hi> or their Parents, ſo that they need the Sacrament of remiſſion of ſins?</p>
                     <p>But ſecondly, If it be ſaid, that our ſoules are indeed derived from the ſoul of <hi>Adam,</hi> then who can ſay, <hi>I have not ſinned;</hi> ſeeing the Originall ſoul of <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It was the Argument which <hi>Pelagius</hi> uſed. If the ſoul be not propagated as well as the body; then onely the bodies (of Infants) are liable to the puniſhment for Originall ſinne; for it may ſeem very hard meaſure, that ſo ancient a ſinne ſhould be laid to the charge of a ſoul newly created, and but one day old.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, when the woman was made out of the body of Man, It is not ſaid, <hi>that God breathed into her noſtrils the breath of life, as it was ſaid of the man,</hi> Gen. 2. 7. Perhaps to intimate that her ſoul was derived with het body from the man.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> confeſſed, that to ſay that ſoules are dayly created, ſeeing God finiſhed the Creation the ſixth day, will ſeeme a violent ſpeech.</p>

                           </gap>w,</hi> &amp; <hi>Repentance,</hi> for repentance it ſelf is a renewing. Renewing is a generall word, &amp; may be diſtributed into two ſorts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> there is a renewing <hi>Sacramental,</hi> and baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, when a man is baptized, or illuminated, and thereby initiated to a new ſtate and way of living ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to new rules of life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> there is a renuing <hi>Moral,</hi> when a man once illuminated or baptized, having falne into greivous ſins, yet by grace given, changeth his wicked courſe of ſinning to a careful and conſcionable new way of living according to direction of the Goſpell. Hence I collect, that the meaning of theſe words is; That he that hath once been renued by baptiſmall illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to repentance or amendment of life, if ſuch a man fall, he cannot the ſecond time be renued by a ſecond baptiſmal renuing, a ſecond baptiſme will not acquit him of his ſins; but yet he is not excluded from a morall renuing, by leaving his ſinning, which is called repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: briefly though he may be renued, yet it may not be by a new baptiſm, &amp; though he may repent, yet his repentance is not to be wrought by a ſecond baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>For the right underſtanding of this expoſition I here lay down to the Readers view theſe few plain propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, a man that after baptiſme falls into ſin though
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115436:148"/>
ever ſo great, yet by the Grace of God, may repent and be recovered.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a man baptized, that is falne in his old carnal living may be renued, and poſſibly may become a new man and a new creature; for a ſinner after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm may he renued, becauſe he may repent.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the reader may take notice, that in this place the words Illuminated, and Renue are of the ſame ſignification. So that the meaning is that, he that is once by baptiſm illuminated, cannot again by baptiſm be illuminated, and he that is once by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm Renued, cannot again by baptiſm be renued to repentance.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, a man may once be enlightned and baptized, and thereby renued to amendment of life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and freedom or acquitment from his ſins paſt, and this by the Spirit of God in the laver of regeneration, and by the vertue of Chriſts death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But after this one renuing by baptiſme, he cannot again be renued to reſipiſcence, newneſſe of life, and acquitment from his ſin by a new baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To renue them</hi>] Al though a ſinner cannot be renued more then once by the Sacramental renovation of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, yet there is another way left open for renuing, and that is penitentiall renovation, and acquiring new Spirituall Graces, and this way is, and ought to be frequently iterated, as it is ſaid, 2. <hi>Cor. 4. 16. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man is renued day by day,</hi> and to this we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted, <hi>Ephe. 4. 23. Be renued in the ſpirit of your mind,</hi> that is, by excluding our ſins, and by acquiring new and higher graces. So that when our Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to renue them</hi>] he cannot poſſibly mean, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing is abſolutely impoſſible, but onely that renuing by a new or ſecond baptiſme is indeed impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>When St. <hi>Peter</hi> deſired, <hi>John 13. 9. That not onely his feet, but his head alſo might be waſhed,</hi> he had this anſwer: <hi>He that is waſhed, needeth not ſave to waſh his</hi>

Indeed daily ſinning, hath need of daily purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by humiliation, confeſſion, repentance, prayer and continuall labour in quitting our ſelves from the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling of ſin; there is that corruption in us that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth daily ſpiritual phyſick to expell it, or rather a daily dying unto ſin, more and more, as we are exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 22. and <hi>Colos. 3. 5.

                     <p>A ſecond kind of <hi>Re-baptization,</hi> was practiſed by the <hi>Cathariſts</hi> or <hi>Novatians,</hi> and alſo after them by the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts,</hi> both of them <hi>African</hi> monſters: but theirs was upon this reaſon. They had ſeperated themſelves from the Church Catholick upon pretence, that it was not a true Church; and therefore they thought that true baptiſme could not their be miniſtred; whereupon, ſuch Seperatiſts as departed from the Catholicks, and joyned with thoſe Hereticks, were entertained by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a new baptiſme, which yet thoſe Hereticks would not confeſs to be a ſecond baptiſme, but a bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, accounting the baptiſme formerly received in the Church Catholick to be void and null</p>
                     <p>And in this very caſe it was, that the religious Biſhop and holy Martyr Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> erred, and his <hi>African</hi> Councell with him.

And this was much preſſed by <hi>Cyprian,</hi> not onely upon the reaſon before alledged, but alſo in <hi>a prudentiall conſideration,</hi> for (ſaith he) <hi>If the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>

                     <p>And indeed, it appeared that the <hi>Novatians</hi> alſo, did therefore rebaptize the Apoſtate Catholicks, not becauſe they did ſeriouſly think their former baptiſme void, but craftily they ſo pretended, that thereby they might gain Proſelytes, and to magnifie their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations.

                     <p>Upon the like reaſons, the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> at this day, will not acknowledge themſelves to be <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> or rebaptized, or take upon them profeſſedly to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter a ſecond Baptiſme. But they ſay, that Infants are not capable of Baptiſme, and therefore ſuch as were ſo ſprinkled by the Church, before they had the uſe of

reaſon, their Baptiſmes are to be accounted void and null, although thoſe Infants were baptized, <hi>In the Name, of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> as Chriſt commanded. So in outward profeſſion, neither the Novations, nor Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, nor our Anabaptiſts do require, or maintain any ſecond Baptiſme, but they ſay, their own Baptiſme is the onely Baptiſme.</p>
                     <p>The Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory reporteth the like caſe in a differing matter which fell, in a paſſage of diſcourſe between two Biſhops, who were both at the ſame time Biſhops of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> the one was <hi>Iohn Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> who was Biſhop of the Catholick Church; the other was <hi>Siſinnius,</hi> a very learned in ingenicus Biſhop of the <hi>Novatian</hi> Congregations, (<hi>For in thoſe dayes all Cathariſts, whether</hi> Novatians <hi>or</hi> Donatiſts liked <hi>well of Biſhops</hi>) theſe two met, and <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> firſt ſaid, <hi>It is againſt the Canon of the Church, that one Citie ſhould</hi>

                        <hi>have two Biſhops. Siſinnius</hi> anſwered that it was true, but withall, <hi>that he knew but one Biſhop in the City of</hi> Conſtantenople. His meaning was, that the <hi>Cathariſts</hi> did not acknowledge <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> to be a Biſhop, nor did the Catholicks acknowledge <hi>Siſinnius</hi> to be one: ſo in effect neither partie could ſay, there were two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and his partie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the Baptiſmes of Hereticks to be void; and the Hereticks accounted theirs to be void, ſo neither party would acknowledge more then one Baptiſme, and yet both ſides erred: for the Baptiſme adminiſtred by the Church was a true Baptiſme, and ſo was that which the <hi>Novatians</hi> miniſtred, as was confeſſed by other Church-men then living; as namely by <hi>Corneleus</hi> the famous Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> a learned man, and a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Martyr, who at that very time ſignified his diſſent<note place="margin">Euſeb. hiſt. l. 6. c 36.</note> from <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in that opinion of rebaptizing the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> teſtifieth.</p>
                     <p>The principall reaſons (beſides policy) which on both ſides were pretended for rebaptization, were theſe two.</p>

Thus he on the other ſide, the Seperatiſts confeſſed, that baptiſme might not be renewed, if it had once been adminiſtred <hi>Bene,</hi> well, but they would not grant that the Catholicks could adminiſter it well.</p>

This I truſt is ſufficient for the clear expoſition of that hard place, which principallie was intended to aſſert the unitie of Chriſtian baptiſme, and not the Impoſſibilitie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                     <p>The ſum of what hath bin ſaid in this expoſition, is comprized in the 4 Concluſion following.</p>
                     <p>Firſt that the Impoſſibilitie there mentioned, is not to be underſtood of an Impoſſibilitie of repentance, nor of an Impoſſibilitie of renuing, but onlie of an impoſſibilitie of being renued, by a new, or Second baptiſme.</p>
                     <p>Secondly. That baptiſme having bin once admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, in that form which is preſcribed by Chriſt; no Second baptiſme may be miniſtred to the parties ſo baptized, upon any pretence either of non age in the baptized, or unworthines, and unfitnes in the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that ſuch baptiſmes, or rather dippings, which are miniſtred by thoſe hereticks who denie the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> and therfore doe not d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>p, in that baptiſmal form which is preſcribed by Chriſt, are utterlie void, and null.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly. That baptiſme rightlie adminiſtred to thoſe who have bin heretically dipped before, is not to be called a re-baptization but a baptiſme.</p>
                     <p>By all that hitherto hath bin objected, It cannot appear; That the blasphemie againſt the Spirit (what
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115436:165"/>
ſoever is meant by that ſin) is abſolutely unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but ſtill there is one remedie left, wherby the ſinner may find help, and that is repentance.</p>

                     <p>IN all that our Apoſtle hath ſaid in this place, of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this grand ſin by treading under foot the Son of God, counting the blood of the Covenant common and vile; caſting away our confidence in Chriſt, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back from him, doing deſpite unto his Spirit of grace, and all this wilfully, and after knowledge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and although he hath affirmed, that (beſides Chriſts all ſufficient ſacrifice once offered on the croſſe) there is none other ſacrifice for ſin, either poſſible, or to be expected; yet after all this grand Impiety and Apoſtacy, it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For albeit, he who doth renounce the Profeſſion of Chriſt plenarily and totally, can find no other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, Redeemer, or Sacrifice for ſin, and ſo long as he continueth in this totall Apoſtaſie, he can reaſonably expect none other iſſue but a fearfull judgement of condemnation, and fiery ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115436:170"/>
for a time did ſo eagerly and ſpitefully renounce and deny Chriſt, that they alſo crucified him, yet they were by St. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorted to repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. yea, and they did actually repent and were baptized,—and continued afterwards ſtedfaſt in the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>

the Elect, and the ſame ſin is not unto death, which in the Reprobate is unto death.</p>
                     <p>The anſwer is, that our Apoſtle calls that ſin, a ſin <hi>not unto death,</hi> which is confeſſed, repented, forſaken and amended, <hi>before our death or departure out of this life,</hi> when a man doth not obdurately continue, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in his ſin untill his death, but forſaketh it in his life-time, ſo that the leaving of his ſin and amendment of life, may <hi>be ſeen by his brother;</hi> for how elſe ſhall a brother ſee, that the ſin is <hi>not unto death,</hi> but by the ſinners leaving it, deſiſting from, and amending it, as by ceaſing from adultery, rebellion, oppreſſion, and the like, for ſo the Apoſtle telleth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſuch as theſe were ſome of yee; <hi>but yee are waſhed, but yee are ſanctified,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11. So that ſinnes <hi>not unto death,</hi> are not ſo called, from the nature or merit of ſin, but from the circumſtance of the time or perſon ſinning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting. Fot (as is ſaid) Every ſin is <hi>mortall,</hi> deadly and unto death eternall, if we look onely on the <hi>merit</hi> of ſin; but every ſin, though the moſt grand and capitall ſin, is <hi>not unto death</hi> if it be <hi>repeated</hi> of, and left, before the departure of the ſoul from the body.

                        <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> The meaning of theſe words <hi>Idoe not ſay he ſhall pray for it,</hi> that this praying, and not praying is to be underſtood of the living, and not of the dead, the practiſe of the Church in praying for penitents, the manner and form of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiastical or external pennance, viewed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Lady Fabiola, in what caſe God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad praying for ſinners in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</head>
                     <p>THere remaineth yet a greater difficultie in the words next following wherby this ſin unto death may ſeem to be ſuch a ſin, as the Apoſtle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth men to pray for, wherby he may alſo ſeem to ſet the brand and mark of abſolute unpardonablenes upon the ſinner, <hi>as</hi> being quite forlorne, and bereft of all remedie, and left utterly to deſperation; for thus we read.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A ſin unto death, I doe not ſay he ſhall pray for it.</hi>] It being granted that the ſin unto death is one of thoſe capital ſins, before mentioned out of <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 31. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19. In which the ſinner continueth impenitently, al his life time, and therin dieth, we are next to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether the Apoſtle meaneth, that ſuch a ſinner ſo dying, is not to be prayed for <hi>after his death;</hi> or whether he mean, that ſuch a ſinner is not to be prayed for <hi>during his life</hi>—time, whileſt he continueth in his ſin without repentance.</p>
                     <p>For if we grant that, by theſe words, a man dying in that ſin, is excepted from being prayed for <hi>after death;</hi> then it will follow that the other ſort of ſinners, which ſin not impenitently unto their death, may be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115436:179"/>
prayed for after death, and ſo <hi>prayers for the dead muſt</hi> be allowed of, as if they were warranted by Scripture, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth neither practice, nor allowe of; although we can not denie, but that the ancient Church uſed them ſo as I have ſhewed above, in my firſt book.</p>
                     <p>To this inquirie, the anſwer is, that the praying or not praying here mentioned, is to be underſtood of men living, and only during their life time, for ſo the Apoſtle meaneth, he that is ſeen, or knowne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs his ſin, to repent, and amend it; may be prayed for by the Church, whileſt he is living; But he that is not perceived, or perceived not to Confeſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and amend his foul viſible, and noted ſins, whileſt he liveth, the Church hath no direction to pray for ſuch a ſin, or for ſuch a ſinner in this ſenſe, that the ſin may be forgiven which is never repented. Or that the ſinner may be pardoned, notwithſtanding his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate perſiſting, and continuing in his ſin, no, not whileſt he is living, and much leſs when he is dead. So, here is no warrant for praying for the dead, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they died penitently, or impenitently, but in what ſenſe, an impenitent ſinner, during his impenitencie, may, and ought to be prayed for in this life, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare hereafter more cleerly, but firſt, I muſt ſhew the Church practiſe in praying for ſinners.</p>

                     <p>The Apoſtle's diſcountenancing, prayer for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinner, is no more then what God himſelf had done before in the old Teſtament, in forbidding man's interceſſion, for averting temporall judgments from rebellious ſinners, as a warning, and intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what he intended to doe to obdurate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinners concerning eternal judgement.

                        <hi>of whom it may be known, that they have ſinned the ſin unto death.</hi>] This propoſition is verie dubitable.

                        <hi>of the woman</hi> and the promiſed <hi>ſeed of Abraham</hi> and the ſonne <hi>of David,</hi> for Chriſt is not from their loyns, if his body came from Heaven; and although a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple well meaning ſoul, ſhould live and die in this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who hath alwayes adhered to the main princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Doctrine, <hi>viz.

                     <p>I anſwer, that I dare not ſo pronounce, becauſe this ſinfull and erroneous conceit of the incarnation is at moſt but one of theſe ſinnes which our Saviour called <hi>A word ſpoken againſt the Sonne of Man,</hi> Matthew 12. 32. For it is onely againſt this humane nature, and no blaſphemy againſt his Holy and Divine Spirit, or Godhead, and of ſuch ſinnes he ſaith, <hi>It ſhall be forgiven him, viz.</hi> If, ſuch a ſinner with an humble heart make an acknowledgement and general confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his ſecret and unknown ſinnes, (wherein this will be included) ſo as is before ſaid, with a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to decline any thing that he knowes to be ſinfull, ſo much (as by aſſiſtance of Gods, Grace) he can ſtill holding himſelf cloſe to the main foundation which the forenamed old Hereticks did not, but ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many blaſphemies againſt the Divine Nature, and alſo polluted themſelves with many fowle Morall vices.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, when Jeſus Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>It ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,</hi> how dare any Man preſume to ſay, <hi>It ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forgiven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For, although the Erroneous conceits of Chriſts Body comming down from Heaven doe diſturb the Order of Gods diſpenſation, and the congruitie of the work of Redemption and correſpondence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with the words of the Covenant, yet it doth not take away, and root up the foundation.
